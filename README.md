# The qfars training in building R packages
======================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ricrossi/qfars.svg?branch=master)]


This package provides functions to query the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (data are a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes).
This is only a "training"" package, thus it merely is an exercise in building up the structure of an R package: you will not probably need it, but

## Getting Started

To quickly learn how to use this package you find a vignette file in the "vignette" folder.

### Prerequisites

You need "R", and maybe "RStudio" if you want your life to be easier.

### Installing

The lastest development version of the package can be loaded directly from GitHub using the devtools package:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("ricrossi/qfars")
library(qfars)
```
